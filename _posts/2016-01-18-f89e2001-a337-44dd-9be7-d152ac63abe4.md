Work.

Last year I used TapRoot to find nonprofits looking for marketing help. 

The Chicago Chess Foundation was about to launch their first fundraiser to give grants to Chicago area schools in need. This program included creating video, copywriting, social media promotion and content. An awesome group of people.
